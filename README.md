# Advent of code 2025

Again.. this year hust 12 puzzles.. at least state now

## PRE-CONFIGURATION
- update YEAR in _.py
- setup interpreter

## 3rd party libs
- python-dotenv
- requests
- aoc (-> see local if you want to use local implementation)

## New day

Clone the _.py blueprint for every new day.

## Puzzle input

Puzzle input is automatically fetched when the valid AOC cookie is specified in .env file. Note that the script must be named with the
number of the day - e.g. 7.py or 07.py for day 7.
Therefore

- clone the .env.sample into .env
- log into ACO with your browser
- search for `session` cookie
- copy & paste the value into .env file

## AOC

AOC is my own library with some helpful classes and functions for AOC.

### LOCAL

In order to use the local installation of aoc-lib, add the path to aoc project as
custom paths in interpreter settings. Therefore

- open project settings
- Python interpreter
- Open the dropdown of the selected interpreter (e.g. Python 3.9 (2022))
- choose Show all...
- switch to the tree icon "Show interpreter paths"
- add a custom path to aoc project

## PUZZLES
